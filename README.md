# Open RiMo - River Monitoring Device


RiMo is an open river monitoring device that could predict river flood and alert the local citizens to evacuate quickly and avoid casualties. 

currently, there is no enough data to predict flood and monitor the river. In 2018 Kerala the flood comes due to unplanned dam's shutter open and suddenly the river quickly flooded and people thought rive water will flow away but it doesn't and flooded all over. 

Dam data is already available from govt agencies  so we don‚Äôt need to build any hardware to measure that, but there are two problems with the data they have, one with the frequency and amount of data collection is not enough to predict, and another one is getting large amount data we need to go through some long-term procedure and it's not publically available

The RiMo will continuously monitor the river parameter such as **water level** , **water flow rate** , **wind rate** , **rain gauge** , **water quality** ..etc to predict a flood and river conditions. 

Our plan is to build the RiMo as much as less expensive and make a kit and distribute to everywhere, and the node will be de-centralized but the data will be centralized in a single cloud platform where everyone can read the river data and use it with an API. 

The project was born in a immersive open hackathon where students, professionals, researchers, makers and anyone with an interest in technology gather together to build a single project, disaster management, awareness and alertness platform in two days. 

> Various states in India has been struggling due to natural calamities, taking away from us our brothers and sisters and forcing the rest out of their day to day life and to the relief camps with no adequate food, clothing and shelter. This is something that happens every year on a global scale.
As educated youth we simply can‚Äôt stand on the borders of safety and watch the world burn. We decided to help by doing what we do best- Code! OpenHack aims to build a Free Platform that can be used by governments and communities who are suffering from natural calamities to organize coordinate relief activities. So this is an open call all technologists, enthusiasts, students, makers and hobbyists to come together to rebuild EARTH. At OpenHack we will only be developing a single project, with Web and Mobile Clients.

The RiMo project first proposed by the hardware team from open hackthon happned in ISC on 2019 , The team consisit of Students and Professionals . You can read more about the begning of project here :

#### How to get involved

We are team consist of students and Professionals , you can cotribute this project by code,design also by valube feedback and we do team meeting via online , you can join there too and share your feedback . all the meeting logs are in the [[MakerGram Open RiMO Forum Category](https://community.makergram.com/topic/65/openhack-open-river-monitoring-system-for-flood-prediction/2).

#### Where to post a question

You can ask question about RiMo in the Github itself by using issues or [MakerGram Open RiMO Forum Category](https://community.makergram.com/topic/65/openhack-open-river-monitoring-system-for-flood-prediction/2).




### Value proposition
[add value proposition here after Week 1]

#### The product

The Product proposed is a River Monitoring system that could primarily help to predict flood secondary monitoring water quality by measuring different parameters like river water level, flow rate, water quality and rain gauge.

#### Pain relievers

predicting the flood will help reduce emergencies and help people to evacuate quickly and save lives, and by monitoring water quality we act for nature and do the needful for lives in the river.  

#### Gain creators

People can get know the flood emergencies and evacuate quickly and by studying the data we can make a decision for the dam‚Äôs shutter.
