# Open RiMo - River Monitoring Device


RiMo is an open river monitoring device that could predict river flood and alert the local citizens to evacuate quickly and avoid casualties. 

currently, there is no enough data to predict flood and monitor the river. In 2018 Kerala the flood comes due to unplanned dam's shutter open and suddenly the river quickly flooded and people thought rive water will flow away but it doesn't and flooded all over. 

Dam data is already available from govt agencies  so we don’t need to build any hardware to measure that, but there are two problems with the data they have, one with the frequency and amount of data collection is not enough to predict, and another one is getting large amount data we need to go through some long-term procedure and it's not publically available

The RiMo will continuously monitor the river parameter such as **water level** , **water flow rate** , **wind rate** , **rain gauge** , **water quality** ..etc to predict a flood and river conditions. 

Our plan is to build the RiMo as much as less expensive and make a kit and distribute to everywhere, and the node will be de-centralized but the data will be centralized in a single cloud platform where everyone can read the river data and use it with an API. 



### Value proposition
[add value proposition here after Week 1]

#### The product

The Product proposed is a River Monitoring system that could primarily help to predict flood secondary monitoring water quality by measuring different parameters like river water level, flow rate, water quality and rain gauge.

#### Pain relievers

predicting the flood will help reduce emergencies and help people to evacuate quickly and save lives, and by monitoring water quality we act for nature and do the needful for lives in the river.  

#### Gain creators

People can get know the flood emergencies and evacuate quickly and by studying the data we can make a decision for the dam’s shutter.
